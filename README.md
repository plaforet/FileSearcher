# FileSearcher
This is support code for the Recursion Project we created for our AP CS A course. It's the methods I wrote to populate the folders with text files and add random words into those files.

Some things of note:
* wordList method fills the wordsList ArrayList with the words from the words list.txt file
* makeFile makes the text files with random words for the names
* writeToFile fills those text files with between 1 and 50 random words
